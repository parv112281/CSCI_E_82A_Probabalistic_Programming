    "Robotics are becoming common place in many business situations. For example in retail sales robotics are used in warehouse management. Amazon is widely known to be a leader in this area. But, according to a recent Wall Street Journal article, UK online grocery retailer, Ocado, is rumored to have even more sophisticated order fulfilment robotics.\n",

    "Not surprisingly, companies like Amazon and Ocado do not disclose much information on their robotics. Nonetheless, we can be sure that sensor fusion is a significant problem. For example, sensor fusion is a significant issue with self driving cars. See for example:\n",

    "These types of complex robots require years, even decades, to develop and perfect. In reality, the processes used in such complex robots are decomposable into a large number of **simple single tasks**. The complete system then operates by integrating the many single tasks into a **multi-task** environment. To avoid this complexity (and finish the course in less than 10 years:) you will address a simple single task problem. "

    "## Scenario  \n",
    "\n",
    "Bob's Orchards is a premium seller of apples and pears. Bob's customers pay a substantial premium for superior fruit. To satisfy these customers, Bob's must ensure that the fruit delivered is correctly packed and perfectly ripe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like many legacy industries requiring specialized human skills, Bob's is facing a talent problem. An expert human inspector will only pass fruit at the perfect ripeness, maximizing customer satisfaction and utility.   \n",
    "\n",
    "However, many of the human inspectors who expertly check each piece of fruit shipped for ripeness are approaching retirement age. Management's attempts to recruit younger people to apprentice as fruit inspectors have been, well, fruitless (oh, sorry!:). Therefore, it has become imperative to find some type of automated system which can reduce the workload on the diminishing number of human inspectors. To address this problem, Bob's is deploying technology from Robots R Us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first robotic system to be deployed at Bob's uses a sensor array to determine if the fruit being shipped is at the correct ripeness. There are two sensors, a color vision system that examines the fruit to determine if it is ripe, and a smell sensor that determines if the fruit is not ripe enough or over ripe. If either sensor indicates the fruit is bad it is not shipped. In addition customers may reject even perfect fruit for no apparent reason, whereas others seem perfectly happy with less than perfect fruit.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distributions, decisions and utilities of this system can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. The unconditional probability distribution of the ripeness of the fruit being packed is known.\n",
    "2. A conditional distribution for the visual color sensor reading conditioned on fruit quality. \n",
    "3. A conditional distribution for the smell sensor reading conditioned on fruit quality. \n",
    "4. A conditional probability distribution of shipping the fruit conditioned on the readings of both sensors. This can be thought of as classifying the fruit as good or bad based on the senor results. There is a decision variable associated with this CPD. The fruit is only shipped if both sensors read positive.  \n",
    "5. There is a conditional probability distribution of a customer accepting an order, or not, depending conditioned on CPD for the fruit classified for shipment and the actual fruit quality. \n",
    "6. There is a utility of the customer accepting or rejecting an order.  "
